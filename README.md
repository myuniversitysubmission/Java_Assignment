# Compact Programming ‚Äì Java Assignment

This repository contains solutions for the *Compact Programming* assignment as part of the FH Dortmund online course on Java programming.  
The assignment is divided into four tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of Java basics, object handling, and algorithms.  

Each task was implemented individually by group members, and the final solutions are documented here.

## üìå Problem Statements & Contributions

### Task 1 ‚Äì Language Basics (Math & Variables)
*Problem:*  
Readings: Language Basics: Variables, Operators, Expressions, Statements, and Blocks 
The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles. The diameter of the Earth is 
approximately 7600 miles. Use the methods in the class Math to calculate, 
(a) the volume of the Earth in cubic miles 
(b) the volume of the Sun in cubic miles 
(c) the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth 
and then output the three values. Treat both the earth and sun as spheres. The volume of a 
sphere is given by the formula 4 pi r^3/3 where r is the radius.

### Task 2 ‚Äì Language Basics (Control Flow & Primes)
*Problem:*  
Readings: Language Basics : Control Flow Statements

Rewrite a program that prints prime numbers up to a given limit with the following requirements:  
- Use a labeled continue instead of break.  
- Do not use a Boolean isPrime variable.  
- Only check divisors up to the square root of the number.

### Task 3 ‚Äì Object Basics (Strings & Characters)
*Problem:*  
Readings: Object Basics and Simple Data Objects, The Life Cycle of an Object,Characters and 
Strings 
In the following code the soliloquy is analyzed character by character to determine the vowels, 
spaces and letters used. Fill in the code that computes the number of spaces, vowels, and 
consonants.

### Task 4 ‚Äì Object Basics (Arrays & Sorting)
*Problem:*  
Readings: Object Basics and Simple Data Objects 
Numbers 
Arrays 
Write a program that sets up a String variable with the soliloquy in the previous question, 
extracts the words from the text and sorts them into alphabetical order. You may define 
'words' however you wish (within reason), but provide your definition with your solution. You 
can use the sorting method of your choice. The simplest one is the bubble sort, which works 
as follows: 
‚Ä¢ Starting with the first element in the array compare successive elements (0 and 1, 1 
and 2, 2 and 3, and so on). 
‚Ä¢ If the first element of any pair is greater than the second, interchange the two 
elements. 
‚Ä¢ Repeat the process for the whole array until no interchanges are necessary. The array 
elements will now be in ascending order. 
‚Ä¢ Run the program once you have written your code. Turn in your code, and the output 
produced when the code runs
